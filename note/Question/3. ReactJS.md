#### Forms and Input Handling
- [ ] How do you create a dynamic form (e.g., add/remove fields) in function components?
- [ ] How do you handle validation for forms in function components?
- [ ] How do you handle controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] How can you optimize the performance of a function component in React?
- [ ] What are the benefits of useMemo and useCallback hooks in preventing unnecessary re-renders?

- [ ] How do you handle dynamic routes and nested routes in React Router with function components?
- [ ] How do you pass props to components when using React Router in function components?

#### Error Boundaries
- [ ] How do you implement error boundaries in React, and how does it differ in function components versus class components?
- [ ] How do you handle errors in asynchronous code (such as API calls) in function components?

#### High-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props
- [ ] What are higher-order components (HOCs), and how do they work in function components?
- [ ] How do you use render props to share functionality between components in function components?
- [ ] Can you explain the difference between HOCs and hooks in React?
